Ecosystem Needs\nFormal chapter setup\nCommunity calendar & core team\nPartnerships with schools, LGUs, and DEVCON PH\nVolunteer engagement and sustainability plan\n | 1. Actors\nStudents & Campus Orgs – Big source of energy through IT/CS orgs and school events.\nCommunity Organizers – Folks from UXB, Flutter Bohol, and SproutUp keep the momentum going.\nDevelopers & Freelancers – They’re here, but not always plugged into the local circles.\nVolunteers – Mostly just the core teams; few others step up consistently.\nTeachers & Profs – Some join events, but more could be involved.\nAlumni in Tech – Not engaged yet — but they could be great mentors or speakers.\nLocal Companies – Around, but not really collaborating with the dev scene.\n\n2. What’s happening on the ground?\nWorkshops & Talks – Happening regularly, and people show up!\nHands-On Events – Hackathons/build days pop up, but not often.\nOnline Spaces – Facebook pages are active, but deeper convos are rare.\nCareer/Portfolio Sessions – Happened before, but not consistent.\n\n3. What’s the community vibe?\nCurious & Hungry to Learn – People esp students want to grow and explore new tools.\nWelcoming – Events feel open and friendly — great energy for first-timers.\nCollaborative (sometimes) – People team up at events, but less so outside of them but is now starting.\nQuiet Talent – Many skilled folks, but not confident to speak or lead sessions.\nCore-Driven – A few lead most things; others attend but rarely help out.\n\n4. What should we focus on next?\nMentorship – Bring in alumni or pros to support students and juniors.\nGrow Volunteer Culture – Make it easier for others to step in and help.\nSpotlight Local Talent – Short talks or show-and-tells to build speaker confidence.\nStronger Campus-Community Ties – Bridge the gap between school orgs and local tech groups.\nCareer Skills Support – Resume reviews, mock interviews, and portfolio sessions, more often. | President – Product Manager\nLeads the chapter, sets overall direction and strategy.\n\nVice President for Operations – Programmer\nManages event execution, internal operations, and logistics.\n\nMarketing Lead – Project Manager\nOversees branding, promotions, and community engagement campaigns.\n\nFinance Lead – Community Leader\nHandles budgeting, sponsorships, and financial tracking.\n\nTechnology Lead – Programmer\nManages technical programs, workshops, and hackathon support.\n\nSecretary – Programmer\nKeeps documentation, meeting notes, and helps with coordination.\n\nCommunity & Partnerships Lead – IT Consulting Company Founder\nBuilds relationships with schools, LGUs, and private sector partners.\n\nnan: Stakeholders / Partners | Top Needs/ Problems | Profile of your chapter audience | Path to target groups / most relevant channels | What makes your DEVCON Chapter unique? | Core challenges from the last year \n\nnan: Local Partners\nSchools & Universities – Bohol Island State University (BISU), Holy Name University, University of Bohol, and other Schools(for student reach, venues, and speaker collabs)\nTech Communities – UXB, Flutter Bohol, SproutUp, Bohol Software FB Group (existing dev groups)\nLocal Companies – ZionLab, local IT/Startup Companies, digital agencies, BPOs (for talent pipelines and hiring needs)\nGovernment Agencies – DICT, DOST, BICTO, DTI (for funding, support, and co-hosting initiatives)\nLGUs – For venue support, and community outreach\nCo-working Spaces / Cafes – The Hamlet Kafehan sa GL and others as event venues or tech-friendly hubs\n\nNational / External Partners\nDevcon Philippines HQ – For branding, mentorship, speaker support, and official community structure\nNGOs & Youth Orgs – For tech-for-good initiatives or outreach (e.g., Young Coders PH, Y4IT) | Not Enough Regular Learning Events\n- We need more workshops, coding nights, and hands-on sessions — not just one-time talks.\n\nTalents Are Hiding\n- Lots of skilled devs here, but they’re not seen. People don’t get to share what they know or show what they’ve built.\n\nNo Clear Mentorship\n- Beginners and students don’t have someone to ask for help or advice as they grow in tech.\n\nCareer Support Is Kinda Missing\n- Few resume reviews, mock job interviews, or help with building a solid portfolio.\n\nGroups Aren’t Teaming Up Yet\n- School orgs, dev communities, and local tech companies aren’t really working together — we could do way more if we joined forces.\n\nGov’t & LGU Support Isn’t Tapped Well\n- DICT, DOST, BICTO, and the LGUs have helpful programs — we just haven’t connected the dots yet.\n\nSame Few People Doing All the Work\n- Organizers are getting tired. We need more people to pitch in and help out — even in small ways. | Students\n- Mostly IT/CS majors hungry for real-world exposure, projects, and network\n\nEarly-Career Developers\n- Fresh grads, junior devs, or freelancers looking to grow their skills and portfolio\n\nLocal Professionals\n- Mid-level devs, designers, and tech workers looking for community, growth, or ways to give back\n\nEducators / Professors\n- Instructors open to plugging into the dev scene or sending students to events\n\nTech Advocates & Organizers\n- Leaders from other communities or civic groups eager to collaborate\n\nGovernment / NGO Reps\n- Stakeholders supporting digital skills development, tech jobs, and innovation | 1.

It's a work in progress but it is something we can be proud of. | We were able to build relationships with various school tech organizations. | We were able to support different tech community in various ways. (Event volunteers, planning and connections) | We were able to organize powerbi events where we get a lot of inquires when we will organize the next powerbi event. | We are still able to uphold our commitment in the DEVCON KIDS program regardless of the challenges.\n\nnan: What can be improved? | More documentation on the worklows and implementing them. | Update database of these organization and their contact info. If possible schedule a courtesy call with each org. | Making the community support more streamline. | Apply all the lessons learned in our initial powerbi events. | Improve public school partnerships.\n\nnan: What are your major or minor events for Q4 and Q1 2024? | Speaker invite from schools.  | Speaker invites from different community. | Powerbi Events | As of this writing, we are planning a hackathon\n\nnan: Most notable projects from 2024 so far? | We have a work in progress website. The website design is ready but we haven't finish developing it. | We are formulating a long term event plan. Annual events so that we can easly measure progress.  Example is the Hackathon that we are planning for Sept.\n\nnan: From 1-10, how would you rate your current chapter's performance? | In terms of number of events executed. We have lower events this year. I do believe proper documentation on workflows, templates and execution will improve performance of the team. To answer the question, I do believe we are at 7 right now. | Other factor is our org structure. A lot happened this year. Active officers tend to wear many hats. While others are inactive. \n\nnan: Links to your latest plans and programs  | Task Sheet\n\nnan: Help needed from HQ for Q4 to 2025? | Our biggest lesson this year is fund raising. Without money, we are paralyzed. What I can think of.... if there's an existing database or a list of companies we can reach out to where we can send out sponsor package that would be helpfull. I understand that we are advised to make x deals only, that is fine. Since the team still needs to have petty cash, the team is formulating plans on how to fund raise without dealing with taxes and reciepts. \n\nnan: Who from your core team are likely going to extend for 2026? What roles or skills need to be added for 2025 officers? | I Alphio, can still lead for 2025 unless someone wants to take my place. I'm willing to step down and take other roles. I'm not sure for 2026 yet. I'm sure I will still be active in the community but maybe as volunteer or advisor. I wanna focus on upskilling because my current salary could not help me in doing community work.  As for my team, I'm not sure yet. I have to talk to them one by one about their plans. | About skills or roles? I do think commitment is more important. Skills can be learned but you must be commited to the cause. \n\n\n\n\nChapter/Section: Iloilo\n\nnan: Retrospective and 2024 Planning\n\nnan: Chapter Name: | Iloilo\n\nnan: Planning attendees and role: | President: Rubeth Joy G.

T&C apply. \n\n\n\n\n\nKey Points in the Agreement\n\nParties Involved:\n\nInternet Computer Protocol (ICP): A general-purpose blockchain for smart contracts.\n\nICP Hub Philippines: Promotes web3 innovation in the Philippines using ICP.\n\nDEVCON Philippines, Inc.: A non-profit supporting Philippine IT development through open-source technologies.\n\n\nReasons for Partnership:\n\nShared goal of educating Filipinos about emerging software development trends and tools in web3.\n\nLeverage DEVCON's 14-year track record of empowering IT students and developers.\n\nPartnership Goals:\n\nCollaborate on web3 education initiatives in the Philippines.\n\nOrganize code camps on smart contracts, community events, and develop online resources.\n\nEquip Filipino developers with Web3 skills and raise awareness of blockchain and decentralized solutions.\n\nTraining\n\nMoving Forward: A Roadmap to Success\n\nThis primer and checklist will guide DEVCON Chapters and Leaders in successfully hosting ICP Smart Contract Code Camps, supporting the goals outlined in the agreement. By following these guidelines and leveraging the strengths of both DEVCON and ICP Hub Philippines, we can contribute to a more skilled and informed Filipino web3 developer landscape.\n\nCode Camp Guidelines\n\nTarget Audience:\n\nStudents (consider shorter attention spans)\n\nDevelopers\n\nBefore You Host:Checklist: * Secure at least 3 trained mentors to guide participants. * Confirm a venue with reliable internet access that can accommodate your expected attendees. * Schedule follow-up meetings with the Program Lead to discuss mentor qualifications and camp logistics.\n\nPre-Event Attendee Checklist (Distribute 2-3 days prior):\n\nAccess and review provided e-learning video materials on ICP Smart Contracts.\n\nComplete the provided setup instructions (software installation, account creation).\n\nConfirm you have a laptop with the necessary software pre-installed.\n\nConfirm your attendance (date, time, location).\n\n\n\nGet a Head Start!\n\nWhile you wait for the official schedule and confirmation of trained mentors, you can take these proactive steps:\n\nAccess Recordings and Resources: Inquire with the Program Lead about any available recordings or presentations from previous code camps. This can provide valuable insights into the curriculum and delivery style.\n\nExplore ICP Learning Materials: Look for online resources and tutorials offered by ICP Hub Philippines or the DFINITY developer community. Familiarize yourself with ICP concepts and development tools.\n\nSetup Your ICP Development Environment: Follow ICP documentation to set up the necessary software and tools for developing smart contracts on the ICP network. This will allow you to experiment and gain hands-on experience before the code camp.\n\nPractice with Sample Projects: ICP Hub Philippines or DEVCON might offer sample smart contract projects. Try building or deploying one of these to solidify your understanding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLessons Learned from Laguna Pilot Online Code Camp:\n\nRepository Configuration: Cover repository configuration best practices.\n\nBasic Git Commands: Instruct on basic Git commands for cloning GitHub repositories.\n\nIDEs: Briefly introduce different Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) participants can use.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent compatibility of ICP\n\n-JavaScript/TypeScript for programming canisters (smart contracts)\n\n-SQL for storing and querying data on-chain \n\n-ExpressJS\n\n-NEXTJS\n\n-SQLite\n\n\n\nLessons from other chapters\t\n\tTips and Overcoming Challenges (Based on Laguna Pilot Experience):\n\nLimited Trainers:\n\nSolution: Have your mentors attend trainings. 5-10 mentors per event would be ideal like what Iloilo did. \n\nConduct a dry-run before any event\n\nLeverage DEVCON Facilitator Training (SME) program to ensure a sufficient number of qualified mentors.\n\nLow Completion Rate:\n\nSolution:\n\nConduct a pre-event setup session or overview call to address potential issues.\n\nOffer incentives like branded shirts for completing pre-event setup tasks.\n\nTroubleshooting Challenges:\n\nSolution: Have mentors/facilitators readily available on-site to assist participants with troubleshooting.\n\nUnfamiliarity with Github:\n\nSolution:\n\nDuring registration, require participants to have a basic understanding of Github. You can provide a URL to relevant resources for those who need to learn.\n\nPartner with schools that have labs equipped with Github and necessary software.\n\nNo Device:\n\nSolution: Partner with local schools to secure venues with computer labs equipped for the code camp.\n\nLocal DEVCON chapters can provide clear written MOUs outlining expectations and a checklist for participants to install necessary software (VSCode, etc.) before the event.\n\n\n\nJuly 18 DEVCON Iloilo Code Camp Learnings  - 61 total deployed ICP projects in one day.  Morning and afternoon sessions and multiple classrooms. 10 trained mentors. 1 Local Facilitator - Joy. Event success was not dependent to Eli’s schedule. Eli just introduced ICP, observed and remote technical assistance.  86% completion rate based on the canister vouchers count received vs deployed.  53% completion rate based on actual attendees vs deployed\n\nEvent Planning and Execution\n\nMentor Training: Prioritize a comprehensive training session for 5-10 mentors per chapter to enhance event effectiveness.\n\nParallel Sessions: Implement two parallel classrooms with distinct morning and afternoon schedules to accommodate more participants.\n\nMerchandise Planning: Initiate the shirt merch proposal at least 3-4 weeks in advance for HQ approval. Consider a price range of 180-200+ PHP per shirt based on quality, print size, and quantity.\n\nEOD Reporting: Create a concise EOD report highlighting key metrics: total participants, voucher codes received, deployed students, mentors, and completion rate.\n\nVoucher Code Management: Accurately forecast attendance due to the 3-5+ day processing time for voucher codes from ICP. Avoid relying on on-the-spot code acquisition.\n\nRole Assignment: Clearly designate leads for logistics, food, finance, school coordination, and registration to streamline operations.\n\nBranding: Develop a unique, locally inspired poster and merch design to create a strong visual identity.\n\nPost-Event Coverage: Assign a dedicated team for post-event reporting and real-time updates, including creative content like TikTok POVs.\n\nKPIS tracking with ICP. Make sure the form submission for completion are clear. We have several errors on the tracking where student submits their GITHUB URL instead of their CANNISTER ID project URL in the correct form. Edit and update the instruction with sample URL in the form and remind this during submission. \n\nAdditional Considerations\n\nThorough Event Evaluation: Conduct a post-event analysis to identify areas for improvement and replicate successful elements in future events.\n\nParticipant Feedback: Gather feedback from participants to understand their experience and expectations.\n\nPartnership Building: Explore opportunities to collaborate with local businesses and organizations for support and resource sharing.\n\nVolunteer Management: Effectively manage and recognize volunteer contributions to ensure event success.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADDITIONAL TIPS FROM ILOILO TEAM - \n\nGitHub Project Deployment Tips:\n\nUse Standard Technologies\n\nStick to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\n\nKeep Your Project Updated\n\nEnsure your GitHub project is always up to date.\n\nCheck dfx.json\n\nVerify that dfx.json is included and matches the version used locally.\n\nOrganize Your Project Structure\n\nEnsure index.html is inside the src folder, and all related files are properly organized within it.\n\nManage Your Images Properly\n\nDouble-check the image paths, ensuring they start with the correct /.\n\nAdopt Best Practices in Naming\n\nUse lowercase letters for folder names and keep them concise and descriptive.\n\n\n\nBefore Deployment:\n\nVerify Folder Location\n\nIn your terminal, ensure you are in the correct project folder.\n\nFollow the Proper Command Order\n\nExecute the deployment commands in the correct sequence to avoid issues.\n\n\nAdditional Tips from Iloilo and tips\n\nEnsure all attendees have the required software installed on their machines (Windows, Linux, or Mac) before the event.\n\nFor Windows users, guide them to enable virtualization in BIOS settings and install the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).\n\nProvide detailed, step-by-step instructions for installing tools like VS Code, Node.js, Git,  \n\nShare the project submission link with attendees well in advance and emphasize the importance of completing the form immediately after deployment.\n\nPrepare and share the workshop presentation slides with attendees, encouraging them to review the materials prior to the event.\n\nRequest attendees to type their chapter information and campus ambassador status in the chat during the pre-event session to track attendance and participation.\n\nConnect with experienced chapter organizers, like Joy from Iloilo, to gather tips and learnings from their previous code camp experiences.\n\nEnsure you have at least 5 mentors available to facilitate the event smoothly and coordinate with them to provide guidance and materials.\n\nAllocate time to introduce and train attendees on using GitHub, as many students may not be familiar with the platform.\n\nOffer incentives, such as t-shirts, to attendees who successfully complete the project submission to motivate them to follow through with the entire process.\n\nIMPORTANT: Implement a system to track who receives coupons and validate that they have indeed met the criteria. After giving the coupon code, make sure it is successfully deployed if not record the error.\n\n\n\nKey points when introducing ICP and Blockchain \n\nBlockchain Technology:\n\nIntroduced in 2009 with Bitcoin, blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger system.\n\nIt records transactions in a secure, transparent, and immutable manner across a network of computers (nodes).\n\nProvides a foundation for cryptocurrencies and the development of decentralized applications.\n\nEthereum and Smart Contracts:\n\nEthereum, launched in 2015, expanded blockchain capabilities by enabling smart contracts.\n\nSmart contracts are self-executing programs on the blockchain, allowing the creation of decentralized applications (dApps).\n\nICP (Internet Computer Protocol):\n\nICP is a new blockchain technology introduced in 2021, developed by the DFINITY Foundation.\n\nAims to create a \"world computer\" - a fully decentralized, scalable, and efficient blockchain network.\n\nDesigned to be an adaptive blockchain, with a decentralized governance system for protocol upgrades.\n\nKey Features of ICP:\n\nScalability: ICP is designed to be unbounded, able to scale without limits in data, computation, and users.\n\nEfficiency: ICP aims to be more efficient than centralized cloud technologies, while being environmentally friendly.\n\nDecentralization: ICP is a fully decentralized network, controlled by a decentralized governance system.\n\nStateful and Serviceless: ICP allows the creation of autonomous, stateful applications without traditional servers or cloud services.\n\nBlockchain Adoption and Potential:\n\nBlockchain technology, including ICP, has the potential to disrupt and replace centralized systems and technologies.\n\nThe vision is for the blockchain to become the \"world computer\" that hosts a wide range of web applications and services in a decentralized manner.\n\nThis transition from centralized to decentralized technology is referred to as the \"blockchain singularity\" or the \"everything stack\" that will eventually replace traditional centralized solutions.\n\nTips and lessons from Davao Code Camp for the next organizers: \n\nCoordination and communication between the partners are essential to ensure that the code camp or the event will run smoothly. \n\nBefore the code camp, participants' knowledge should be identified to assess where we should focus on our code camp. Some blockers are in GitHub repositories creation; most students need to be more knowledgeable about GitHub.\n\nInstead of teaching them ICP, we spend time helping them create their git repository. On the other hand, some workstations don't work at all. Also, many students are interested in the Code Camp; however, the laboratory can only accommodate 30 students. \n\nMaybe next time, we can hold a code camp on the CAMPUS DEVCON level so that all interested students can participate. \n\n\n\n\nLessons from Pampanga Code Camp\n\nSchool Name\n\nHoly Cross Colleges\n\nTotal Number of Attendees\n\n70\n\nProfile of the attendees course, and level\n\n2nd & 3rd Year students from Computer Science, Information Technology, and Computer Engineering programs.\n\nTotal voucher codes received\n\n59\n\nTotal deployed and completed\n\n53\n\n% completion:\n\n75.14%\n\nWhat worked well:\n\nMany participants successfully deployed projects despite internet connectivity challenges.\n\nWhat Can Be Improved:\n\nA short pre-event meeting is recommended to ensure all team members are aware of their tasks.\n\nEnsure a stable internet connection to avoid issues with coupon code redemption.\n\nLessons from Iloilo ICP Code Camp:\n\nSchool Name\n\nWestern Visayas State University\n\nTotal Number of Attendees\n\n76\n\nProfile of the attendees course, and level\n\nBSIT (3rd Year) & BSCS (1st Year)\n\nTotal voucher codes received\n\n81 (expired coupons included, 76 working)\n\nTotal deployed and completed\n\n70\n\n% completion:\n\n92.11%\n\nWhat Worked Well:  \n\nMost coupon codes were successfully redeemed.  \n\nIssue resolution was prompt once the internet problem was identified.  \n\nWhat Can Be Improved:\n\nEnsure stable internet connectivity to prevent conflicts in coupon code redemption.  \n\nConduct a pre-event technical check to identify potential DNS or network-related issues.\n\nWe can integrate the ICP Code Camp into the Campus DEVCON Ambassador’s main event to attract more students or even blend it with professionals to broaden participant coverage.\n\nTo improve future events, a short pre-event meeting is recommended to align all team members on their tasks. Additionally, updated and standardized guidelines for code camps are critical to this.\n\nAdditional Note:\n\n Fewer students were available in the afternoon, as the sessions were split between morning and afternoon.\n\n\n\nLessons from Iligan-CDO Code Camp\n\nCDO\n\nX\n\nIligan Mentors \n\nWe suggest that we need to have an effective teaching style.\n\nOn Oct 12, 2024, we worked with CDO mentors to provide details in the form of Notion notes. Following this, one mentor conducted a live demo, during which they intentionally introduced possible errors and walked them through the steps to troubleshoot and solve the problems that arose. Additionally, other mentors were available to provide personalized guidance to students who needed extra support or were struggling to follow along.\n\nIt is also important to provide a website template for students to edit and personalize, rather than building it from scratch.\n\nFor the blockchain presentation, it’s essential to create a powerpoint that is visually engaging and kid-friendly. Since the students are new to the concept of blockchain, we should approach them as kids and avoid using too many technical terms that might overwhelm them. Instead, we should focus on explaining the applications and relatable scenarios where blockchain technology is being used. As students tend to forget jargon easily, it’s crucial to encourage interactive discussions and promote questioning from the students.\n\nAfter presenting blockchain to some students, I asked them about their understanding. They recalled the concept of blockchain because of the relatable example we provided."

Full version here \n\nCentralized Due Diligence &  Management as a Corporate Account: All financial sponsorship transactions must go through DEVCONNECT PH INC's corporate bank account, and any financial transaction involving this account requires prior written authorization from the national office. Local chapters are prohibited from establishing their own bank accounts.\n\nPrioritize Direct Partnerships and Content Focus for Local Events: Chapters should prioritize in-kind sponsorships or direct payments from sponsors to suppliers to minimize financial risk. The focus for local events should be on developing high-quality content, leveraging national resources for logistical support.\n\nMandatory Due Diligence and Formal Proposals: Thorough review of all financial transactions is compulsory, especially for major events. Formal event proposals with detailed documentation must be submitted via email months in advance to facilitate due diligence.\n\nSustainability Planning and Allocation: Major events should be planned with a focus on sustainability, and a percentage of savings generated after tax compliance should be allocated for future program sustainability and nationwide growth of DEVCONNECT PH INC.\n\nStrict Compliance and Zero Tolerance for Corruption: Chapters and officers must strictly adhere to these guidelines. DEVCON has a zero-tolerance policy for corruption, and violations can lead to sanctions, including suspension or revocation of chapter status. All MOAs/MOUs involving cash or sponsorships require national office approval.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTLDR Best Practice based on 200+ events since 2024. Full version here\n\nPrioritize Targeted & Diverse Events: Focus on specialized workshops for various skill levels and offer a wide range of event topics (AI, Web3, etc.) and formats (hackathons, DEVCON Kids) to maximize engagement and cater to diverse interests.\n\nStrengthen Volunteer Development & Support: Invest in training, clear roles, recognition, and resources (food, potential merchandise) for volunteers, ensuring smooth leadership transitions for chapter sustainability.\n\nOptimize Internal Communication & Proactive Planning: Implement structured project management, detailed checklists, clear role assignments, and early publicity (at least 3 weeks prior) to streamline operations and avoid miscommunication.\n\nCultivate Strategic & Proactive Partnerships: Implement a timeline for outreach, prioritize mutually beneficial collaborations with diverse organizations (GAD, DICT, tech companies, NGOs), and explore annual partnership opportunities.\n\nFocus on Program Enhancement & Addressing Challenges: Deliver high-demand workshops with hands-on experiences, expand DEVCON Kids programs, address low visibility through strong marketing, and develop diversified fundraising strategies for sustainability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTLDR of MOU 101. Full version here\n\nMandatory HQ Involvement: Notify Area Leaders and DEVCON HQ of any potential agreement before drafting. Send all draft MOUs to Area Leaders and HQ for thorough review and obtain explicit HQ clearance before signing.\n\nRigorous Due Diligence and Risk Assessment: Conduct thorough due diligence on potential partners, assess all potential legal, political, financial, and reputational risks, and clearly define responsibilities and obligations within the MOU.\n\nExplicit Limitation of Authority: Include clear and unambiguous language stating that the local chapter MOU does not represent or bind the national organization, DEVCON Philippines. Use specific phrasing like: \"This MOU is solely between [Partner Name] and DEVCON [Chapter Name], a local chapter of DEVCON Philippines, and does not bind or represent the national office of DEVCON Philippines.\"\n\nFinancial Prudence and HQ Approval: Local chapters should not enter into agreements that involve financial obligations without explicit permission from DEVCON HQ. Consult legal counsel when necessary for financial and legal implications.\n\nPrioritize Simple Agreements When Possible: Utilize Simple Summary Agreements for limited scope, short-term engagements with minimal legal and financial risks, reserving MOUs for long-term, strategic partnerships with significant resource sharing or joint initiatives where a formal expression of intent is crucial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Best Practices for Local Chapters (Education & Advocacy):**\n\n\n\n* **Localize Content:** Tailor workshop content and speaker topics to address the specific skills gaps and interests within your local tech community.\n\n* **Mentorship Programs:** Establish local mentorship initiatives connecting experienced professionals with students or junior developers.\n\n* **Collaborate with Educational Institutions:** Forge strong relationships with local universities, colleges, and even high schools to promote tech education and DEVCON membership.\n\n* **Industry Engagement:** Partner with local tech companies to offer internships, job shadowing opportunities, or sponsor local chapter events.\n\n* **Advocate for Tech Education:** Participate in local events and forums to advocate for the importance of technology education and digital literacy within your community.\n\n* **Showcase Local Success Stories:** Highlight the achievements of your local members to inspire others and demonstrate the impact of DEVCON.\n\n* **Community Building Beyond Events:** Create online forums or regular informal meetups to foster a continuous sense of community among your members.\n\n* **Promote Inclusivity:** Actively work to ensure diverse participation in your events and leadership, reflecting the richness of your local community.\n\n* **Feedback Loops:** Regularly solicit feedback from your members to ensure your initiatives are relevant and meeting their needs.\n\n* **Document and Share:** Document your local chapter's successful initiatives and share them with other chapters through your Area Leader to contribute to the national best practices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon flags from HQ for first-time chapter officers:\n\nDon't use the national office logo without explicit permission. Always clearly indicate the <DEVCON chapter name> alongside any branding.\n\nDon't spell \"Devcon\" in lowercase. It should always be written as DEVCON.\n\nDon't use personal Gmail accounts or forms for DEVCON-related activities. Always use and obtain official @devcon.ph accounts and utilize Google Slides, Sheets, and other Google Workspace tools for compliance.\n\nDon't be involved with DEVCON solely for personal gain or \"clout.\" Understand that DEVCON is built upon a \"pay it forward\" philosophy and driven by a passionate network of volunteers.\n\nDon't sign and send any Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) without prior approval from the Headquarters (HQ) and a thorough reading of the relevant guidelines provided.\n\nDon't use the term \"Membership\" when referring to sign-up forms. When in doubt, use <DEVCON CHAPTER NAME> \"Volunteer Community\" instead.\n\nDon't use DEVCON and our assets for political purposes. While DEVCON encourages civic engagement and nation-building, it maintains a strict non-partisan stance.\n\nDon't forget our safe space and privacy guidelines. Always adhere to these principles in all DEVCON interactions and activities.\n\nDon't hesitate to read and ask questions when in doubt. It's always better to clarify than to make assumptions or errors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe, at the national level, especially through your area leaders, are here to support your local chapter every step of the way.
